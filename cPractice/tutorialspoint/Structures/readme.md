# Structures

Arrays allow to define type of variables that can hold several data items of the same kind. Similarly structure is another user defined data type available in C that allows to combine data items of different kinds.

Structures are used to represent a record. Suppose you want to keep track of your books in a library. You might want to track the following attributes about each book âˆ’

- Title
- Author
- Subject
- Book ID

## Defining a Structure

To define a structure, you must use the struct statement. The struct statement defines a new data type, with more than one member. The format of the struct statement is as follows 

```
struct [structure tag] {

   member definition;
   member definition;
   ...
   member definition;
} [one or more structure variables]; 
```

## Accesing Structure Members

To access any member of a structure, we use the member access operator (.). The member access operator is coded as a period between the structure variable name and the structure member that we wish to access. You would use the keyword struct to define variables of structure type.

## Structures as Functions Arguments

You can pass a structure as a function argument in the same way as you pass any other variable or pointer.

## Pinters to Structures

You can define pointers to structures in the same way as you define pointer to any other variable -

` struct Books *struct_pointer; `

Now, you can store the address of a structure variable in the above defined pointer variable. To find the address of a structure variable, place the '&'; operator before the structure's name as follow -

` struct_pointer  = &Book1;

To access the members of a structure using a pointer to that structure, you must use the -> operator as follows -

` struct_pointer->title; `

## Bit Fields

Bit fields allow the pacjking of data in a structure. This is a especially useful when memory or data storage is at a premium. Typical examples include -

- Paclkiing several objects into a machine word. e.g. 1 bit flags can be compacted.

- Reading external file formats -- non-standard file formats could be reda in, e.g., 9-bit integers.

C allows us to do this in a structure definition by putting :bit length after the variable. For example. 

``` struct packet_struct {
   nsigned int f1:1;
   unsigned int f2:1;
   unsigned int f3:1;
   unsigned int f4:1;
   unsigned int type:4;
   unsigned int my_int:9;
} pack; ```

Here, the packed_struct contains 6 members: Four 1 bit flags f1..f3, a 4-bit type and a 9-bit my_int.

C automatically packs the above bit fields as compactly as possible, provided that the maximum length of the field is less than or equal to the integer word length of the computer. If this is not the case, then some compilers may allow memory overlap for the fields while others would store the next field in the next word.
